<img src="https://github.com/jiaoyining/jiaoyining.github.io/blob/master/photo3.png?raw=true"  width = "170" height = "220" align="right">Currently, I am doing research remotely at [UNC-biag Lab](https://biag.cs.unc.edu/), supervised by [Prof. Marc Niethammer](https://biag.cs.unc.edu/author/marc-niethammer/). Before that, I was a research intern at [United Imaging Intelligence](https://www.uii-ai.com/en), supervised by [Prof. Qian Wang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=m6ZNDewAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN) and [Prof. Dinggang Shen](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=v6VYQC8AAAAJ&hl=zh-CN). I received my M.S. degree from Institute for Medical Imaging Technology, [School of Biomedical Engineering](http://bme.sjtu.edu.cn/En), [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](http://en.sjtu.edu.cn/) in 2020, under the supervision of [Prof. Qian Wang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=m6ZNDewAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN) in the[ Medical Image Computing Lab](http://mic.sjtu.edu.cn/). I received my B.Eng. degree from [Honors College](https://honors.nwpu.edu.cn/) at [Northwestern Polytechnical University](https://www.nwpu.edu.cn/) in 2017.  
My research interest includes machine learning for healthcare and medical image analysis.  Also, I am always open to new challenges.
