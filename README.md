# Teaching
At SJTU, I served as a Teaching Assistant in Spring 2019 for Computer Vision in Biomedical Engineering. 

# Hobbies
In my free time, I enjoy [reading books](https://jiaoyining.github.io/readinglist) and writing poems. I was invited to *Chinese Poetry New Discovery* Poetry Camp in 2018 as one of the twelve selected campers and some of my works were published in *Poetry Periodical*,*Chinese Poetry*, etc.
