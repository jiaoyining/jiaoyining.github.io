Previously, I reveived my M.S. degree from Institute for Medical Imaging Technology, [School of Biomedical Engineering](http://bme.sjtu.edu.cn/En), [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](http://en.sjtu.edu.cn/) in 2020, under the supervision of [Prof. Qian Wang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=v6VYQC8AAAAJ&hl=zh-CN) in the[ Medical Imaging Computing Lab](http://mic.sjtu.edu.cn/). I received my B.Eng. degree from [Honors College](http://honors.nwpu.edu.cn/) at [Northwester Polytechnical University](https://www.nwpu.edu.cn/) in 2017. 
My research interest includes machine learning for healthcare and medical image analysis.
