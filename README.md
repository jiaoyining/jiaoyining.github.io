# Teaching
At SJTU, I served as a Teaching Assistant in Spring 2019 for Computer Vision in Biomedical Engineering. 

# Hobbies
In my free time, I enjoy [reading books](https://github.com/jiaoyining/jiaoyining.github.io/readinglist.md) and wirting poems. I was invited《Chinese Poetry》“New Discovery” Poetry Camp and some of my works were published in *Poetry Periodical*,*Chinese Poetry*, etc.
